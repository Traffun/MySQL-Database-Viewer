# MySQL-Database-Viewer
This was Database project that I had to do for a class where I had to show specific queries via a program.
This project was ran using XAMPP which has Apache server built into the toolkit. Place the php files into your htdocs file for your XAMPP directory and bootup the MySQL console on XAMPP to load in the database.
The view uses a drop down to determine which query to process. Once the user has selected their desired query they then push the Engage button that then told the server to navigate them to a new view that displays the queries.
