# MySQL-Database-Viewer
This was Database project that I had to do for a class where I had to show specific queries via a program.
My partner worked on the insertion of data into our database while I created this PHP view for the user.
The view uses a drop down to determine which query to process. Once the user has selected their desired query they then push the Engage button that then told the server to navigate them to a new view that displays the queries.
